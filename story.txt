Once upon a time, there was a simple peasant farm boy named Phil who lived on a little farm in the middle of nowhere. He dreamed of one day being a great astronaut. But alas, all he know about was driving a tractor. He once told his momma that he wanted to be an astronaut, but she just said "Nno no - you're a farm boy, and your Dad was a farmer, and his Dad was a farmer, and that's all you'll ever be!" Of course, there's great honor is growing crops for people to eat, but little Phil dreamed of a different life...
 
Phil was wandering along the rows of corn late one evening. The sun was setting and he knew he should be getting back home for dinner. Suddenly, a bright burst of light came from his left, blinding him for a moment. In his dazed state, he swore a huge triangular object darted toward sthe sky from the direction of the light. He ran home to tell his parents what had happened.

Getting home, he told his parents about the UFO he had witnessed. Seeing 
the excitement that witnessing the UFO gave him, his parents finally 
realized that their son's true calling was indeed to be an astronaut. So 
they finally let him go off and leave the farm behind.

EPILOGUE: They still worried for him, of course, as parents are wont to 
do. In fact, when she heard Phil had been deployed on a mission to 
photograph the rings of Saturn, his mother went through the whole trouble 
of putting together a care package, making sure to include all his 
favorite ring-shaped foods. She wrapped it expertly in a glittery wrapping 
paper but got stuck when it came time to address it. How exactly did one 
express mail to the outer solar system?

As if to answer her question, a huge, triangular shape decended outside 
her window, flooding the entire living room with harsh light. Nonetheless, 
she could just make out the decal on the object's hull, helpfully at eye 
level: UPS.
